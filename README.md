This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

It runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### Change the API base
- Open https://github.com/shubham-web/psdreplika/blob/frontend/src/components/MockupEditor.js
- Find below line update it to whatever hostname your backend is running on or leave it as is if you are running it on localhost.
```
this.apiBase = "http://localhost/";
```
